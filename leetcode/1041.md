```java
 On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north.  
 The robot can receive one of three instructions:
 "G": go straight 1 unit;
 "L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
 "R": turn 90 degress to the right.
 The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

 Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

1.  Input: "GGLLGG"  
Output: true  
Explanation:   
The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).  
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.  

2.  Input: "GG"  
Output: false  
Explanation:   
The robot moves north indefinitely.  

3.  Input: "GL"  
Output: true  
Explanation:   
The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...  
```

>Intuition  
Let chopper help explain.  
(Chopper from one piece, will let him go if illegal)  

>Starting at the origin and face north (0,1),  
after one sequence of instructions,  

>if chopper return to the origin, he's in an obvious circle.  
if chopper finishes with face not towards north,  
it will get back to the initial status in another one or three sequences.  

>Explanation  
(x,y) is the location of chopper.  
d[i] is the direction he is facing.  
i = (i + 1) % 4 will turn right  
i = (i + 3) % 4 will turn left  
Check the final status after instructions.  

```java
/*
Complexity  
Time O(N)  
Space O(1)  
*/
    public boolean isRobotBounded(String ins) {
        int x = 0, y = 0, i = 0, d[][] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, { -1, 0}};
        for (int j = 0; j < ins.length(); ++j)
            if (ins.charAt(j) == 'R')
                i = (i + 1) % 4;
            else if (ins.charAt(j) == 'L')
                i = (i + 3) % 4;
            else {
                x += d[i][0]; y += d[i][1];
            }
        return x == 0 && y == 0 || i > 0;
    }
```
